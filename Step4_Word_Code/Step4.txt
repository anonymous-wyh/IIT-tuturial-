Step 4: Implement the Solution (Word Coding)
START
time = the system clock
food_in_bowl = weight of remaining food in the bowl
food_in_feeder = weight of remaining food in the feeder
consumed_food = weight of consumed food

1. Check whether current time is feeding time.
   IF time = 08:00 OR 14:00 THEN
       Proceed
   ELSE
       Go to END


2. Check the food in the bowl; if remain is more than the setting value, skip the dispensing process.
   IF food_in_bowl >= 2kg THEN
       Skip dispensing and go to END
   ELSE
       Dispense food into bowl


3. After dispensing, check food in the feeder. And alert if the remaining food in the feeder is inadequate
   IF food_in_feeder < 2kg THEN
       Trigger Alert
   ELSE
       Display "Food dispensed and available"


4. Monitor consumption. And alert if the consumed food is less than 1kg.
   Measure the change of food in bowl for 30 minutes.
   IF consumed_food < 1kg THEN
       Trigger Alert
   ELSE
       Continue


END
