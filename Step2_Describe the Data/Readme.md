Step 2: Organise and Describe the Data
- List input types (e.g., real-time clock, food level sensor, weight sensor under bowl).
- List expected outputs (e.g., rotate motor, send alert).
- Provide sample values and operational constraints.
Deliverable: Data table with inputs/outputs and operational parameters.

| Value                               | Type   | Parameter       |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | --------------- |
| Time to dispense food                | Input  | 8:00 + 12:00    |
| Weight of dispensed food             | Input  | 2kg             |
| Real-time Weight of food remaining in feeder | Input  | 1kg             |
| Minimum weight of food remaining in feeder  | Input  | 100g            |
| Minimum weight of consumed food      | Input  | 50g             |
| Alert time                           | Input  | 30mins          |
| Alert                                | Output | On / Off        |
| Weight of consumed food each time    | Output | 100g            |
