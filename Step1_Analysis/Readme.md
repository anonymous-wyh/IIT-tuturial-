Step 1: Understand and Define the Problem (Analysis)
- What features must the feeder include?
1.	dispense food following schedule.
2.	Monitor the quantity of food that has been consumed.
3.	Alert staff if something unexpected happens
automatically dispense food and alert it something unexpected happens.

- What inputs and outputs are needed
Inputs: 
1.	Time to dispense food
2.	Weight of dispensed food
3.	Real-time Weight of food remaining in feeder
4.	Minimum weight of food remaining in feeder (alert if remaining gets less than the minimum value)
5.	Minimum weight of consumed food (alert if consumed food is less than the preset value.
6.	Time (alert if dispense food dost not get consumed within the preset time)
All value related to weight is measured by weight sensors.

Outputs:
1.	Alert
2.	Weight of consumed food each time

- What are possible assumptions or limitations (e.g., limited memory, one type of pet
food)?
Besides the limitation above,
1.	Weight sensors are easy to get disturbed (e.g., Pets’ toys)
2.	The quantity of dispensed food needs complex calculation depending on the pets’ weight and age.
