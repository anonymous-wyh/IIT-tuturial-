# Pet-feeder-project in Assessment1 by u3272931

Background: Automated Pet Feeder System
A local animal shelter is looking for a low-cost, programmable automated pet feeder that can:
- Dispense food for cats and dogs at scheduled times.
- Monitor whether food has been consumed or the amount of food that has been consumed.
- Alert staff if thereâ€™s an issue (e.g., no food dispensed, food not eaten).
They want a solution that could eventually be implemented using low-cost components (like a servo motor and sensors), but your task is to design and simulate the logic and behaviour of the system first.
